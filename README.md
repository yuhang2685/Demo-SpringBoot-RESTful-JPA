# DemoSpringBootRestJPA
This demo is parallel to DemoSpringBootRestMySQL using JPA instead of MySQL

Author: Dr. YUHANG ZHAO

Introduction: 
In this demo we supply a quick-start code base with explanation for constructing a REST service with JPA.

Overview:
In this demo we covered the use of some new stuffs, 
i.e., DB configuration in application.properties, 
JPA interfaces "CrudRepository" and "JpaRepository",
@Entity, @Id,
CRUD JPA methods, 
customized JPA methods, 
user defined JPA methods by DB Query, 
dependency "jackson" for XML format, 
content negotiation,  
"Optional<>" type.

Future Work: Replace JPA with DATA REST.

- Windows 7
- Spring Tool Suite 3.9.9.RELEASE
- Spring Boot v2.1.7.RELEASE
